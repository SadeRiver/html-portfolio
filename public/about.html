<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Sade. I was an English teacher for ten years, working with young learners, teens and adults, until 2024, when I decided that my ideal job would be programming.
  Why do I think it's my ideal job? Well, I love puzzles. I love cracking codes, anything to get my head thinking. I have a lot of patience and I always finish projects I start.
</p>

<p>I am also an animal lover. I say hi to every dog I see in the street and have helped at shelters and charities. I have a kind soul and prefer to be surrounded by children or animals, I am at ease around them.
  That said, I am also a team player and quick with a joke. I thrive working with other people and achieving our common goals. I am quite a social butterfly, but also very dedicated to my work.

</p>

<p>My hobbies are also varied. I enjoy diverse things from artistic activities, such as painting or writing poetry, to physical activities such as going to the gym or going on hikes and swimming.
  Sport is a bit part of my life, and I try to keep a very active and healthy lifestyle.
